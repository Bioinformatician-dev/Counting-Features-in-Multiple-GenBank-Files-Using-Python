# Counting Features in Multiple GenBank Files Using Python

In this task, we aim to create a Python script that can parse multiple GenBank files and count the various biological features present in each file. GenBank files are widely used in bioinformatics to store nucleotide sequences and their annotations. By counting the features, we can gain insights into the biological data contained within these files.
